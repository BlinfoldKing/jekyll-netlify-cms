When we bought our historic home, we knew it would need ‘special’ paint. I had been on enough historic home tours to know whatever the restoration specialists were putting on the wall was not the same finish or quality as what I had been using in our NYC apartments. Four years later, I have some resources for you, and I’ll keep adding to this post as new products are introduced. If you know of a great resource, or have a favorite, comment below! The modern state of paint is very ‘plastic’ looking to me. You can see the latex in latex paint when you use anything but a flat finish. Before we put anything on our plaster walls, I researched the options to death. I wanted our walls to have that slightly imperfect, rich feel. Almost matte but not quite. The color is so deep, you think you can see into it. Our solid wood doors get a coat of high gloss paint that is hand brushed on, giving them a historic feel. Figure out how you want your walls to catch light, then find the right product to match. I love the soft light from old windows. The quality of light in a home that was built before electricity has a soft, necessary beauty about it. Here’s my list go-to brands and products:  
1. Farrow and Ball 
2. Benjamin Moore 
3. Portola Paints and Glazes 
4. Kalklitir 
5. Romabio Masonary Points 
6. Master of Plaster 
7. Valspar
