When we bought our historic home, we knew it would need ‘special’ paint. I had been on enough historic home tours to know whatever the restoration specialists were putting on the wall was not the same finish or quality as what I had been using in our NYC apartments. Four years later, I have some resources for you, and I’ll keep adding to this post as new products are introduced. If you know of a great resource, or have a favorite, comment below!
